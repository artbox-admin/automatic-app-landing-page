# Privacy Policy
Artbox and its developer take your privacy seriously. That is why no personally identifiable information is ever collected. Artbox does not sell, and never will sell, any user data. The only data that is collected is basic app usage statistics in order to help make the app better. 

When you use Artbox, you are asked to create profiles for artists and add their names, date of birth, and a profile picture. Additionally when you add projects, you enter a picture and project description. None of this data is ever collected or sent outside of your device or iCloud account. This information is yours and yours alone. If you don't want to store your Artbox data in iCloud, you must disable iCloud Sync for Artbox in your devices's settings.

## What data is collected
The type of data that Artbox does collect is solely for improving the app. This type of data includes things like device type, iOS version, App version, launch count, and feature usage. This data is completely anonymous and never includes personally identifiable information. Artbox uses the privacy-conscious service [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com) for the aggregation of this data.
